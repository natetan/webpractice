				<p class="intro3">I graduated from Franklin High School (in Seattle) in 2014 with the mindset that everything was easy. However, after taking my first quarter at the University of Washington as a Freshman, I realized how different it was from high school. Teachers didn't hold your hand through tough crowds or spoon feed you chocolate pudding. As a matter of fact, they would throw it on the ground and tell you to lick it off. It's this kind of adversity I found myself in, as an unprepared fish trying to find my way through the ocean. I was but a single tree in an entire rainforest. It's a weird kind of feeling, with no one constantly nagging you to do your homework, or to get to class on time. That kind of pedagogy was all but relinquished when I stepped onto the smooth bricks of Red Square.</p>
				<p class="intro3">Getting lost was easy, but going under was child's play. The college workload started off as soft echoes in my head, then turned into irrelevant white noise in the back of my mind. Like a marathon with Usain Bolt, falling behind was as simple as one hesitant moment. When I finally reached the 26th mile, drenched in sweat and dying of thirst, another lap is added, and by the time that happens, I've been lapped twice. It's all in metaphors, but college was the tide that took me by surprise, and before I knew it, I'd been swept out to sea.</p>
				<p class="intro3">It was only halfway through the winter when I finally found out what I enjoyed doing. It came in the form of logic, disguised by computer screen. I was given riddles which I solved with what I now call <i>code</i>. Discovery always interested me, and I loved the idea of building things from scratch. The creativty I grew up with came in the form of scribbles on paper and the changing of colors on paper, but I replaced them with taps on a keyboard. As a child, trying to find something I enjoyed doing seemed so distant, so <i>untouchable</i>, but now I have found the x that marked my map.</p>
